# Architecture

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.26+ (module declares `go 1.26`; the toolchain auto-fetches a matching version on build if the installed `go` is older but supports toolchain switching, i.e. Go 1.21+)
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`)
- **Email**: SMTP only (`internal/email/smtp.go`). SendGrid and Resend were removed - see [auditing.md](auditing.md#dead-code--removed).
- **Database**: SQLite (for history tracking via `modernc.org/sqlite`)
- **Config**: YAML (`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`)
- **Browser automation**: chromedp, for `fill`/`confirm` commands and CAPTCHA detection

## Key Concepts

### Broker
Each broker in `data/brokers.yaml` (top-level key `brokers:`) has:
- `id`: Unique lowercase hyphenated identifier (e.g., `spokeo`, `been-verified`)
- `name`: Display name
- `email`: Privacy/removal contact email (may be empty string - see below)
- `website`: Company website (optional)
- `opt_out_url`: Direct opt-out link (optional)
- `region`: `us`, `eu`, or `global`
- `category`: `people-search`, `marketing`, `background-check`, `financial-b2b`, `data-intermediary`, `device-id-only` (tracks by cookie/device ID, not name/email - can't be reached via this tool's standard profile-based request), `requires-id` (won't act on a request without a government-issued ID document or similar heavyweight identity verification - this tool won't supply one on your behalf), or `non-broker` (see below)
- `priority`: `high`, `medium` or `low` - how much this broker matters to someone trying to get removed. Purely a filter (`--priority`, and the web UI's priority selector); it composes with `category`/`region`/status rather than replacing them, so "high priority people-search brokers" is one query. `send` and the web UI's bulk send also order high-priority brokers first, which matters when `daily_send_limit` truncates a run. See [Broker priority](#broker-priority) for how the shipped values were assigned.
- `description`: One short sentence on what the company actually does, optional. Rendered as the "What they do" column on the web UI's brokers page so you can tell a people-search site from an ad-tech SSP without leaving the page; empty renders as a dash. Not a filter, and never guessed - an unsourced description is worse than none.
- `notes`: Free-text, optional - used to record why an entry looks unusual (e.g. "use the form, not email")
- `tags`: Optional list of *disposition* tags from the closed vocabulary in `broker.DispositionTags` - `b2b-only` (told us it holds no consumer data at all) and `form-only` (holds consumer data but refuses email). Distinct from `category`, which is the sector; see [code-patterns.md](code-patterns.md) for why. `Broker.Sendable()` blocks every send path to a tagged broker, and both the web UI's disposition selector and `list-brokers --tag` filter on them.

#### The `non-broker` category

A handful of entries aren't data brokers at all: search engines, industry
preference services and suppression registries - Google/Bing results
removal, DMAChoice, OptOutPrescreen, the Do Not Call registry, the DAA
WebChoices ad-industry opt-out. They show up on every published opt-out
list, so leaving them out of the database means the information lives
nowhere; but they are things you act on yourself through a web form, not
parties you send an erasure request to.

They are therefore recorded with **`email: ""` always**, which is enforced
by a test (`TestNonBrokerEntriesHaveNoEmail`). That keeps them out of every
send path automatically - `send`, the single-broker endpoint and bulk "Send
to All" all skip address-less entries - while still surfacing them in
`list-brokers --missing-email` and the pipeline, which is exactly the
manual-follow-up flow they belong in. Each carries a `notes` explaining
what to do there instead (also test-enforced).

Note the ordering caveat recorded in their notes: delisting a page from a
search engine doesn't remove the broker page behind it, so search-engine
removal is worth doing *after* the brokers themselves have been dealt with.

To hide them from listings entirely, add `non-broker` to
`options.excluded_categories` in `config.yaml`.

#### Broker priority

The shipped `priority` values were assigned by cross-matching the database against published broker-coverage lists, then banding the result. A broker scores points for each independent source that names it, plus a bump for being a people-search site (those publish a searchable profile of you personally) or an EU broker (this fork exists for GDPR Article 17 use, so an EU-established broker is the most actionable target for its user). `high` is roughly "named by several sources, or a top-tier aggregator"; `medium` is "named by at least one"; `low` is the long tail. Any site categorised `people-search` is `high` regardless of score.

For `non-broker` entries, priority means "how much this manual action is worth doing" rather than "how badly this party needs emailing" - they are never emailed either way.

Sources used, in rough order of weight:

- Consumer Reports' *Data Defense* study (the 13 people-search sites it tested against 7 removal services)
- Optery's open-source data broker directory (CC BY-NC-SA), specifically its plan-tier field - their entry-level ("Core") coverage is the closest published proxy for "what the base plans actually include"
- PersProtect's open dataset of 499 US brokers and opt-out links (CC BY 4.0)
- The *Big-Ass Data Broker Opt-Out List* (yaelwrites)
- The Duke Sanford report's list of the largest US consumer-data aggregators, plus the credit bureaus, applied as an explicit override so the big aggregators aren't ranked by people-search popularity
- datenanfragen.de's company database (CC0) for EU credit agencies and address dealers

None of these agree with each other, which is the point of scoring across them rather than adopting any one list wholesale. To re-derive the values, re-run that cross-match and rewrite the `priority:` line of each entry; the tests in `internal/broker` assert every shipped entry carries a valid value.

**Brokers with `email: ""`** can't be reached by `send` at all - they only take requests through a web form/DSR portal, or the address bounced and was cleared by `cleanup-bounces`/`mark-bounced`. Use `eraser list-brokers --missing-email` to see them; they need manual follow-up outside the tool.

### Templates
Three email templates (`internal/template/templates/`):
- **GDPR**: Invokes EU Article 17 "Right to Erasure" - the correct default for EU users
- **CCPA**: Invokes California Consumer Privacy Act
- **Generic**: General privacy request referencing multiple laws

### Flow
1. Load user config from `~/.eraser/config.yaml`, resolve the active profile (see [multi-profile.md](multi-profile.md))
2. Load brokers from `data/brokers.yaml`
3. Filter by region and exclusions (`broker.Filter`), then by `--priority` if given (`broker.FilterByPriority`), then order high-priority first (`broker.SortByPriority`)
4. For each broker, render email template with profile + broker data
5. Send via SMTP, capped at `options.daily_send_limit` per rolling 24h window (`send` and the web UI's job sender both read this same config value - keep them in sync, see [code-patterns.md](code-patterns.md#known-quirks) for the history)
6. Record result in SQLite history, tagged with the active profile's ID; `send` skips brokers already successfully emailed in the last 25 days (per profile) so re-running is always safe
